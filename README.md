## Run our project
Run the python file project.py   
All visualisation will be saved in the folder names Html.  
There is one html file for each visualisation and the file index.html include all visualisation.

Since running project.py takes a long time, all html files are already saved in the folder.

### Dependencies 
We used these python packages, make sure to install them before running project.py :
- altair
- altair_saver
- pandas
- numpy
- geopandas
- gpdvega

## Critique on Visualisation 1
### Goals : 
- How do baby names evolve over time? 
- Are there names that have consistently remained popular or unpopular? 
- Are there some that have were suddenly or briefly popular or unpopular? 
- Are there trends in time?
### Weaknesses
- looks messy, all names are on the same graph
- hard to differentiate unpopular names from one another
### Strengths
- The most popular names of each year can be easily seen
- Interactability : one name can be selected to see it's full timeline
### does it acheive the goals
All the questions can be answered expect for the unpopular part of them.


## Critique on Visualisation 2
### Goals : 
- Is there a regional effect in the data?
- Are some names more popular in some regions? 
- Are popular names generally popular across the whole country?
### Weaknesses
### Strengths
### does it acheive the goals

## Critique on Visualisation 3
### Goals : 
- Are there gender effects in the data? 
- Does popularity of names given to both sexes evolve consistently?
### Weaknesses
- For each year, only one name per gender can be seen
- Both sides are the same width but the X axis aren't in the same proportions
### Strengths
- For the most popular name of each gender, the effect of gender is easily spotable
- Macro/micro graph : Can be looked at as a whole or in more detail
### does it acheive the goals
Both question can be answered but we can answer the second one only for the most popular names.
