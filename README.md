## Reviews on Visualisation 1
### Goals : 
- How do baby names evolve over time? 
- Are there names that have consistently remained popular or unpopular? 
- Are there some that have were suddenly or briefly popular or unpopular? 
- Are there trends in time?
### Weaknesses
- looks messy, all names are on the same graph
- hard to differentiate unpopular names from one another
### Strengths
- The most popular names of each year can be easily seen
- Interactability : one name can be selected to see it's full timeline
### does it acheive the goals
All the questions can be answered exept for the unpopular part of them.


## Reviews on Visualisation 2
### Goals : 
- Is there a regional effect in the data?
- Are some names more popular in some regions? 
- Are popular names generally popular across the whole country?
### Weaknesses
- If we want to observe more than the top 3 most and least popular names, the graph quickly becomes cluttered.
### Strengths
- We can see the distribution of popular and unpopular names across the entire territory.
### does it acheive the goals
Yes, the visualization effectively shows regional effects and the popularity of names in different regions, despite the potential clutter when displaying more names.

## Reviews on Visualisation 3
### Goals : 
- Are there gender effects in the data? 
- Does popularity of names given to both sexes evolve consistently?
### Weaknesses
- For each year, only one name per gender can be seen
### Strengths
- For the most popular name of each gender, the effect of gender is easily spotable
- Macro/micro graph : Can be looked at as a whole or in more detail
### does it acheive the goals
Both questions can be answered, even though we focus on the most popular name fo each year, we can see how popularity evolve by years by looking at the evolution of the percentage .
